Show "Linked mentions" at the bottom of each note.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Backlinks panel below editor content showing all notes that link to current note
- [ ] Each backlink shows: note title, surrounding context snippet, click to navigate
- [ ] Collapsible panel (default expanded if backlinks exist)
- [ ] Updates when notes are saved (incremental index update)
- [ ] Backlinks index stored at `.scratch/backlinks.json`
- [ ] Index rebuilt on app startup, updated incrementally on note save/delete/rename

## Technical Notes

Backlinks index format:
```json
{
  "note-id": ["linking-note-1", "linking-note-2"]
}
```

Rebuild by scanning all notes for `[[...]]` patterns on startup. On save, diff old/new wikilinks and update index. Expose via Tauri command for frontend.
