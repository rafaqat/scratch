Colored callout boxes with icon picker.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/callout` slash command inserts a callout block
- [ ] Types: info (blue), warning (yellow), tip (green), danger (red), note (gray)
- [ ] Icon picker to change callout type
- [ ] Rich text content inside callout (nested blocks)
- [ ] Serializes to GitHub-flavored markdown: `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]`
- [ ] Parses GFM callout syntax from markdown files

## Technical Notes

Use `createReactBlockSpec` with `content: "inline"` or nested block support. Map to GFM alerts syntax for portability.
