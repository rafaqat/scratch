Colored callout boxes with icon picker.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `/callout` slash command inserts a callout block
- [x] Types: info (blue), warning (yellow), tip (green), danger (red), note (gray)
- [x] Icon picker to change callout type
- [x] Rich text content inside callout (nested blocks)
- [x] Serializes to GitHub-flavored markdown: `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]`
- [x] Parses GFM callout syntax from markdown files

## Technical Notes

Use `createReactBlockSpec` with `content: "inline"` or nested block support. Map to GFM alerts syntax for portability.

| 2026-02-13 | Design | Block uses createReactBlockSpec with content:"inline" for rich text inside callout. Type prop selects callout variant. Type picker via dropdown in render. Shared schema created in Wikilink.tsx with both custom inline and block specs. Markdown round-trip via pre/post-processing in lib/callout.ts (inject on parse, restore on export). Slash menu customized in Editor.tsx. |
