Ship 3 reference plugins to demonstrate the plugin system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **GitHub Issue Sync** — Fetches issues from a repo, creates notes in a folder, updates on re-sync
- [ ] **Daily Journal** — MCP tool that creates/appends to today's journal note (date-named)
- [ ] **Quick Capture** — Append-only tool for fast note capture from CLI/agents (inbox pattern)
- [ ] Each plugin has a README with setup instructions
- [ ] Plugins work out of the box with `gh` CLI and standard tools

## Technical Notes

These serve as documentation-by-example for plugin authors. Keep them simple — each under 30 lines of YAML. The daily journal plugin is essentially:
```yaml
tools:
  - name: journal_append
    description: "Append to today's journal"
    params:
      text: {type: string, required: true}
    action:
      type: append_note
      id: "journal/{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}"
      content: "\n- {{time:HH:mm}} {{text}}"
```
