Ship 3 reference plugins to demonstrate the plugin system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **GitHub Issue Sync** — Fetches issues from a repo, creates notes in a folder, updates on re-sync
- [x] **Daily Journal** — MCP tool that creates/appends to today's journal note (date-named)
- [x] **Quick Capture** — Append-only tool for fast note capture from CLI/agents (inbox pattern)
- [x] Each plugin has a README with setup instructions
- [x] Plugins work out of the box with `gh` CLI and standard tools

## Technical Notes

These serve as documentation-by-example for plugin authors. Keep them simple — each under 30 lines of YAML. The daily journal plugin is essentially:
```yaml
tools:
  - name: journal_append
    description: "Append to today's journal"
    params:
      text: {type: string, required: true}
    action:
      type: append_note
      id: "journal/{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}"
      content: "\n- {{time:HH:mm}} {{text}}"
```

## Results

### Files Created
- `plugins/github-issue-sync.yaml` — GitHub Issue Sync plugin (3 tools: list_issues, sync_issues, fetch_issue)
- `plugins/github-issue-sync.md` — Setup and usage documentation
- `plugins/daily-journal.yaml` — Daily Journal plugin (3 tools: append, read_today, read_date)
- `plugins/daily-journal.md` — Setup and usage documentation
- `plugins/quick-capture.yaml` — Quick Capture plugin (3 tools: capture, view_inbox, clear_inbox)
- `plugins/quick-capture.md` — Setup and usage documentation

### Key Design Decisions
- All plugins use `shell` action type (instead of `note_op`) because date/time templating (`{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}`) is not natively supported by the template engine which only substitutes `{{param}}` keys from arguments. Shell commands provide `date` for timestamp generation.
- Plugins reference `SCRATCH_NOTES_FOLDER` environment variable for portability; users set this to their notes folder path.
- GitHub Issue Sync uses `gh` CLI with `--json` and `--jq` flags for structured output without extra dependencies.
- Daily Journal creates `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files with timestamped bullet entries.
- Quick Capture follows the "inbox" pattern: single `inbox.md` file with timestamped, optionally tagged entries.
- Each plugin includes 3 tools (9 total across all plugins) covering the primary use case plus read/utility operations.
