Parse `[[note-title]]` wikilinks in markdown, render as clickable links in BlockNote.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `[[Note Title]]` syntax parsed during markdown→BlockNote conversion
- [ ] Rendered as styled inline link (distinct from regular links)
- [ ] Click navigates to the linked note (creates if doesn't exist)
- [ ] Autocomplete popup when typing `[[` — searches note titles
- [ ] `[[Note Title|display text]]` alias syntax supported
- [ ] Preserved as `[[...]]` when serializing back to markdown
- [ ] Broken links styled differently (red/dashed)

## Technical Notes

Implement as BlockNote inline content (custom mark or inline node). The autocomplete can reuse the command palette's note search logic. Markdown preprocessing in `src/lib/svg.ts` pattern — intercept `[[...]]` before BlockNote parses it.
