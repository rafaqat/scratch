KaTeX-powered math rendering.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/equation` slash command inserts block equation
- [ ] Block mode: `$$...$$` rendered as centered display math
- [ ] Inline mode: `$...$` rendered inline within text
- [ ] Click-to-edit with live preview
- [ ] KaTeX error display for invalid LaTeX
- [ ] Serializes as `$$...$$` (block) and `$...$` (inline) in markdown

## Technical Notes

Add `katex` npm dependency. Block equation as custom BlockNote block. Inline equation as custom inline content/mark. Consider `@blocknote/katex` if it exists, otherwise custom implementation.
