Render a database as a kanban board grouped by a select column.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Board view option in database block (toggle between table/board)
- [ ] Cards grouped by a configurable select column
- [ ] Drag-and-drop cards between columns (updates frontmatter field)
- [ ] Card shows configurable fields (title + 1-2 preview fields)
- [ ] Add new card inline in any column
- [ ] Column reordering matches select option order

## Technical Notes

Reuse the existing kanban board pattern from the stories system. The stories board UI (if any) can be generalized here.
