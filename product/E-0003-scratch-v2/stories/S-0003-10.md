Auto-generated TOC from headings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/toc` slash command inserts a table of contents block
- [ ] Lists all headings (H1-H3) with indentation by level
- [ ] Click heading entry scrolls to that heading
- [ ] Live updates as headings are added/removed/edited
- [ ] Serializes as `[toc]` placeholder in markdown
- [ ] Styled to look unobtrusive (lighter text, compact)

## Technical Notes

BlockNote custom block that reads the editor's block tree to find heading blocks. Re-renders on editor content change (debounced). Simple implementation — just query heading blocks from the editor API.
