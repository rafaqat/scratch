Display word count, character count, and reading time in the editor footer.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Stats bar at the bottom of the editor showing: words, characters, reading time
- [ ] Updates in real-time as the user types (debounced at 500ms)
- [ ] Reading time calculated at 200 words/minute
- [ ] Counts exclude frontmatter, code blocks, and markdown syntax
- [ ] When text is selected, show selection count alongside total count
- [ ] Stats bar can be toggled on/off via View menu or Cmd+Shift+W
- [ ] Preference persisted in user settings

## Technical Notes

Simple feature. Extract plain text from BlockNote's document model, count words/chars. Display in the footer area (currently shows "Last saved X ago").

The footer already exists in `Editor.tsx` — extend it with a right-aligned stats section. Use `useMemo` to avoid recalculating on every render.

For selected text counting, listen to BlockNote's selection change events.
