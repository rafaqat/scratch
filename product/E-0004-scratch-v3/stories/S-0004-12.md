A calendar view for databases that have a date column, showing rows as events on a monthly/weekly grid.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New view type "Calendar" available in database view switcher
- [ ] Monthly grid showing days with row cards on their respective dates
- [ ] Rows positioned based on the selected date column
- [ ] Click a date to create a new row with that date pre-filled
- [ ] Click a row card to open/edit the row
- [ ] Drag row cards between dates to update the date field
- [ ] Navigate between months with left/right arrows
- [ ] "Today" button to jump to current month
- [ ] Rows without a date shown in a "No date" section below the calendar
- [ ] Week starts on Monday (configurable via settings, stretch goal)

## Technical Notes

**View config in `_schema.md`:**
```yaml
views:
  - id: calendar
    type: calendar
    dateColumn: due_date
```

**Frontend:**
- New `DatabaseCalendar` component alongside existing `DatabaseTable` and `DatabaseBoard`
- CSS Grid for the calendar layout (7 columns x 5-6 rows)
- Each day cell is a drop target for drag-and-drop
- Row cards show title + optional color indicator from a select column
- Use `date-fns` (already a dependency via BlockNote) for date calculations

**No backend changes needed** — calendar is purely a frontend rendering of existing database rows filtered/grouped by date.
