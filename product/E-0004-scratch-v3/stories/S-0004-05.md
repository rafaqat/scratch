A horizontal divider/separator block for visually breaking content into sections.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Available via slash menu: `/divider` and `/hr`
- [ ] Typing `---` on a blank line auto-converts to a divider block
- [ ] Renders as a styled horizontal line (not just a plain `<hr>`)
- [ ] Non-selectable as text — clicking positions cursor above or below
- [ ] Can be deleted with Backspace when cursor is on the line after it
- [ ] Serialized to markdown as `---` (three dashes)
- [ ] Styled to match the editor theme (adapts to light/dark mode)

## Technical Notes

Simple custom block with no props and no editable content. The rendering is purely visual — a centered horizontal line with some margin. This is one of the easiest blocks to implement.

Markdown serialization: `---` already means horizontal rule in standard markdown. Just need to ensure the preprocessor and postprocessor handle it correctly with BlockNote.
