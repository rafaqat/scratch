Toggle between narrow (focused) and full-width editor layouts, like Notion's page width toggle.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Toggle button in the editor toolbar or `...` menu: "Full width" / "Default width"
- [ ] Default width: centered content with max-width (e.g., 720px) — current behavior
- [ ] Full width: content expands to fill the available editor area
- [ ] Per-note preference stored in frontmatter as `wide: true`
- [ ] Global default configurable in Settings → Appearance
- [ ] Smooth transition animation when toggling
- [ ] Tables, databases, and code blocks benefit most from full width
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut: Cmd+Shift+F to toggle width

## Technical Notes

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
wide: true
---
```

**Implementation:** CSS-only change. The editor container already has a max-width. Add a `.wide` class that removes the max-width constraint. The toggle updates both the frontmatter (persisted) and the CSS class (immediate).

**Settings integration:** Add a "Default page width" toggle in Appearance settings. When a note doesn't have a `wide` frontmatter field, use the global default.

This is a simple but satisfying feature — especially useful for database-heavy notes and technical documentation.
