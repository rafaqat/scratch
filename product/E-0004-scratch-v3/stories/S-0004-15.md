Bulk import notes from other apps and export notes in various formats.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Export single note:** Cmd+Shift+E opens format picker (Markdown, HTML, PDF)
- [ ] Markdown export: clean markdown without frontmatter (option to include frontmatter)
- [ ] HTML export: styled HTML document with embedded CSS
- [ ] PDF export: rendered via print-to-PDF (Tauri webview API)
- [ ] **Export all notes:** Settings → Export → "Export all as Markdown" (creates a zip)
- [ ] **Import:** Settings → Import → select files (`.md`, `.txt`, `.html`)
- [ ] Imported `.html` files converted to markdown using turndown or similar
- [ ] Import from Notion: accept exported `.zip` from Notion (markdown format)
- [ ] Import preserves folder structure from zip archives
- [ ] Progress indicator for bulk import/export operations

## Technical Notes

**Export formats:**
- Markdown: already the native format, just copy the file
- HTML: render the note through BlockNote's HTML serialization, wrap in a styled template
- PDF: use Tauri's `webview.print()` or `window.print()` to generate PDF

**Notion import:** Notion exports as a zip of markdown files with a folder structure. These are standard markdown and should work directly — just extract to the notes folder. May need to handle Notion's specific link format (`[Page Title](Page%20Title%20hash.md)`).

**Bulk operations:** Use Tauri's file dialog for multi-file selection. Process files in batches to avoid UI freezing.
