Multi-column layout that allows placing blocks side-by-side, like Notion's column feature.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Available via slash menu: `/columns` or `/2-columns`, `/3-columns`
- [ ] Default: 2 equal-width columns
- [ ] Support 2, 3, and 4 column layouts
- [ ] Each column can contain any block types (paragraphs, lists, images, etc.)
- [ ] Column widths adjustable by dragging the separator between columns
- [ ] Columns collapse to single column on narrow viewports (responsive)
- [ ] Drag blocks between columns
- [ ] Serialized to markdown using a custom fenced format (see below)
- [ ] Add/remove columns via context menu on the column block

## Technical Notes

**Markdown format:**
```markdown
:::columns
::: col
Left column content
:::
::: col
Right column content
:::
:::
```

This is the trickiest editor block because BlockNote's block model is linear (not nested grids). Options:
1. Use BlockNote's `children` prop for nested block support
2. Implement as a custom React component that manages its own block state
3. Use CSS Grid for the visual layout

The column separator drag should use a resize handle similar to database column resizing. Column widths stored as percentages in the block's props.
