Full-width cover images at the top of notes, like Notion's page covers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "Add cover" button appears on hover above the note title
- [ ] Cover displayed as a full-width banner image at the top of the editor
- [ ] Cover image is cropped/positioned — user can drag to reposition vertically
- [ ] Gallery of built-in cover images (gradients, patterns, photos)
- [ ] Upload custom image from disk (copied to `.assets/covers/`)
- [ ] Stored in note frontmatter as `cover: "relative-path"`
- [ ] Cover image height adjustable (small/medium/large via context menu)
- [ ] "Change cover" and "Remove cover" options on hover
- [ ] Cover images not shown in the sidebar (editor only)

## Technical Notes

**Frontmatter storage:**
```yaml
---
cover: ".assets/covers/gradient-blue.jpg"
cover_position: 50
---
```

`cover_position` is a percentage (0-100) for vertical positioning within the crop area.

**Built-in covers:** Bundle 10-15 gradient/abstract images in the app. Store them in `src/assets/covers/` and copy to the user's `.assets/covers/` on first use.

**Image handling:** Reuse the existing `copy_image_to_assets` Tauri command pattern. Cover images should be resized/optimized on copy to keep file sizes reasonable (max 1920px wide).
