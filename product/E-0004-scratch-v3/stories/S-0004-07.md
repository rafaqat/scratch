Add emoji icons to notes, displayed in the sidebar and at the top of the editor page.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "Add icon" button appears on hover above the note title (like Notion)
- [ ] Clicking opens an emoji picker with categories and search
- [ ] Selected emoji displayed large above the note title in the editor
- [ ] Emoji displayed as prefix in the sidebar note list
- [ ] Stored in note frontmatter as `icon: "emoji-character"`
- [ ] Click existing icon to change it, right-click to remove
- [ ] Random icon suggested when "Add icon" is clicked (can be overridden)
- [ ] Icons visible in search results and command palette

## Technical Notes

**Emoji picker:** Use an existing React emoji picker library (e.g., `emoji-mart` or `@emoji-mart/react`). It provides categories, search, and skin tone selection.

**Frontmatter storage:**
```yaml
---
icon: "📝"
---
```

**Sidebar display:** Prepend the emoji to the note title in the `NoteList` component. If no icon, show the current default note icon.

**Editor display:** Large emoji (32-48px) positioned above the `# Title` heading, with hover controls to change/remove.
