Show the folder path of the current note as a clickable breadcrumb trail above the editor.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Breadcrumb bar displayed between the toolbar and the editor content
- [ ] Shows: Root > Folder > Subfolder > Note Title
- [ ] Each segment is clickable — navigates to that folder (selects it in sidebar)
- [ ] Root segment shows the notes folder name (not full path)
- [ ] Truncated with `...` when path exceeds available width
- [ ] Hidden for notes at the root level (no folder nesting)
- [ ] Updates immediately when note is moved to a different folder

## Technical Notes

Simple presentational component. Derives breadcrumb segments from the note's relative path. Place in the editor header area, styled to match Notion's subtle gray breadcrumbs.
